def interpolate_line_smart(E0, N0, E1, N1, min_grade_delta=0.01, force_minmax=True):
    """
    Given a continuous line that passes through a discrete DEM image, will
    interpolate height values from the DEM using linear interpolation. This
    function uses a smart algorithm to produce a simplified but high resolution 
    line interpolated in height (``q``) direction.

    How it works:
    
        1) Assume line is running through an x/y grid of DEM points.
        
        2) At any point in line, immediately surrounding DEM points will 
           contribute to (bi)linear interpolate height at that point.
        
        3) A 'maximal' resolution interpolation of the line will interpolate
           for each point in the DEM grid, e.g. determine height as line enters 
           each new x/y location in the grid.
          
        4) It is also possible for a local maximum/minimum along the line to 
           occur between a certain series of surrounding points. Whether such a 
           point exists and its location can be calculated solving the quadratic 
           equation defined by the linear interpolation to find the presence of 
           a vertex.
           
        5) Each interpolated point (x, y, q) contributes to a new segment on the
           path.
           
        6) This will produce a large number of interpolated points for. To remove
           redundant or practically-redundant points, filter these according to
           changes in grade. If the grade of that segment is similar to the last 
           segment (difference in grade < ``min_grade_delta``), then combine the 
           two segments to simplify the path. This produces a path with a
           smaller number of segments but still maintaining most height 
           information in the line. Maximum/minimum points on the line (where 
           grade sign changes) will always be kept if ``force_minmax`` is ``True``.
           
    Does not catch exceptions from failed DEM lookups, so these will be 
    propagated to the caller. If length of line is more than hard limit, by steps
    algorithm will be used instead.

          NZTM2000 coordinates of line to interpolate
        min_grade_delta : float
