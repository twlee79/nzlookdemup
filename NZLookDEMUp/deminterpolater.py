def interpolate_line_ideal(E0, N0, E1, N1, min_grade_delta=0.01, force_minmax=True):
    """
    Given a continuous line that passes through a discrete DEM image, will
    interpolate height values from the DEM using linear interpolation.

    If ``samples`` is not None, will interpolate with given number of samples
    along line. Otherwise,advanced line interpolation algorithm than will
    produce a simplified but maximal resolution line interpolated in height
    (``q``) direction.

    How it works:
    1) Assume line is running through an x/y grid of DEM points.
    2) At any point in line, immediately surrounding DEM points will contribute
    to linear interpolate height at that point.
    3) To obtain maximal resolution of
    line, determine height as line enters each new x/y location in the grid.
    4) It is also possible for a local maximum/minimum along the line to occur between a
    certain series of surrounding points. Whether such a point exists and its location
    can be calculated solving the quadratic equation defined by the linear
    interpolation to find the presence of a vertex.
    5) Each interpolated point (x, y, q) contributes to a new segment on the path.
    6) If the grade of that segment is similar to the last segment (grade_delta),
    combine the two segments to simplify the path. This produces a path with a
    smaller number of segments but still maintaining most height information in the
    line. Maximum/minimum points on the line (where grade sign changes) will always
    be kept if ``force_minmax`` is True

    min_grade_delta : number
      min delta between two grade segments to keep segments separate, if delta
      is less than this the segments will be merged to simplify the interpolated
      line
    force_minmax : boolean
      whether to force min/max points on line to be kept regardless of grade_delta

    returns a list of (E, N, q, index) tuples, where

    dist : distance of this point from start in grid units
    q : height of point
    grade : grade of from last point to this point (d_q/d_dist), None in first segment
    d_dist : delta of dist from last point, None in first segment
    d_q : delta of q from last point, None in first segment
    index : increasing index number of the point(up to last point), may not be sequential
    but first point   will always be ``0`` and last point will be <0 (-1 if this algorithm
    used, -2 if simple algorithm used because line was too long)


    Does not catch IndexErrors from failed DEM lookups, so these
    will be propagated to the caller.

    If line length is more than 300 voxels in one direction,
    simple algorithm will be used instead.
